\begin_layout Abstract
Heavy ion irradiations at high dose rates are often used to simulate slow
 and expensive neutron irradiation experiments.
 However, many differences in the resultant modes of damage arise due to
 unique aspects of heavy ion irradiation.
 One such difference was recently shown in pure iron to manifest itself
 as a double peak in void swelling, with both peaks located away from the
 region of peak displacement damage (DPA).
 In other cases involving a variety of ferritic alloys there is often only
 a single peak in swelling vs.
 depth that is located very near the ion-incident surface.
 We show that these behaviors arise due to a combination of t

 separate effects: 1) suppression of void swelling due to injected interstitials
, and 2) preferential sinking of interstitials to the ion-incident surface,
 which are very sensitive to 
\change_inserted 1028221600 1442084805
the 
\change_unchanged
irradiation temperature and atomic displacement rate.
 Care should therefore be used in collection and interpreting of data from
 the depth range outside the Bragg peak of ion irradiation experiments,
 as it is shown to be more complex than previously envisioned.

Introduction and Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Charged particle irradiation is frequently used to simulate the effect of
 neutron irradiation on microstructural evolution of reactor structural
 alloys, but is generally conducted at much higher displacement rates in
 order to compress the time required to reach very high DPA levels needed
 to observe phenomena such as neutron-induced void swelling and embrittlement

.
 When optimized to maximize simulation of void swelling, there is not a
 one-to-one correspondence between microstructures observed under neutron
 and ion irradiation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary reasons for this lack of correspondence are various consequences
 of the increased DPA rate, very short ranges of the bombarding ion, consequence
s of strong gradients in DPA rate along the ion range and local defect imbalance
s arising from the bombarding ion

\end_inset

.
 Additionally, there are second-order effects such as ion-induced sputtering

 and swelling-induced compressive states in the thin irradiated film that
 produce a one-dimensional (not three-dimensional as in the neutron irradiation
 case) flow of material toward the ion-incident surface

 effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Swelling of both neutron and ion irradiated metals has often been shown
 to exhibit an incubation period before the onset of steady-state swelling.
 This incubation period is strongly dependent on DPA rate even in the absence
 of microchemical evolution

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many alloys the onset of swelling requires that a microchemical evolution
 involving segregation and precipitation first occur, but the rate constants
 involved in the point defect and precipitation sequences are usually rather
 different, producing different incubation behavior at different DPA rates.
 The very short ion ranges not only allow a strong influence of the specimen
 surface on defect loss and dislocation loss that are atypical of neutron
 irradiation, but strong gradients in DPA rate along the ion range provide
 an internal rate effect on defect production

, and also provide a driving force for elemental segregation along the ion
 path 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Pechenkin2013"

\end_inset

, thereby influencing the microchemical evolution that often precedes the
 onset of swelling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Defect imbalances arising during ion irradiation arise from forward scattering
 involved with ion-atom collisions and the spatial distribution of injected
 ions, the latter having a very strong effect on swelling that is designated
 as the injected interstitial effect

In a companion paper in this conference 
\change_unchanged
Garner et al.
 review the result of experiments conducted on pure iron and various ferritic-ma
rtensitic alloys showing that the net effect of the various neutron-atypical
 aspects is to produce a depth dependence of void swelling that often bears
 no resemblance to the depth distribution of the atomic displacement rate

 Under some irradiation conditions swelling only occurs near the specimen
 surface, and under other conditions the swelling vs.
 depth is more complex, sometimes producing two peaks, neither corresponding
 to the position of maximum displacement rate

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, ion beams are often rastered to provide more spatially-uniform
 damage fields while introducing non-uniform temporal distributions compared
 to neutron irradiation.
 This latter effect is one of the more important neutron-atypical processes
 that strongly affect swelling.
 Since rastering and injected interstitials are both suppressive and synergistic
, especially on void nucleation, their interaction must be recognized and
 factored into data analysis.
 Two recent papers demonstrate the strong influence of rastering to suppress
 void swelling

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we could ignore all of these atypical influences and examine an alloy
 that swells easily without much of an incubation period, one might assume
 that the swelling vs.
 depth profile should mirror the dose rate vs.
 depth profile, but this would be an incorrect assumption.
 In general, alloys of even simple composition such as solute-free Fe-Cr-Ni
 ternaries have been observed to exhibit a large range of swelling vs.
 depth profiles, frequently with no resemblance to the DPA vs.
 depth profile

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to minimize these influences, the ion irradiation community has
 learned to conduct irradiations on simple and complex alloys by not rastering
 the beam and by choosing a narrow volume-slice at an examination depth
 that minimizes the effects not only of the ion-incident surface but especially
 the surprisingly strong injected interstitial effect 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Garner1983,Shao2014"

\end_inset

.
 However, the fullest utilization of the ion irradiation technique would
 require an understanding of the evolution of swelling vs.
 depth over the entire ion range, allowing extraction of data over a much
 larger portion of the ion range.
 With so many neutron-atypical processes operating simultaneously during
 ion irradiation, a full understanding requires that a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

peel the onion

 approach be used, starting with the simplest metals and alloys, moving
 to more complex alloys, isolating and studying each neutron-atypical process
 at each level of compositional and microstructural complexity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our approach to date has been to examine these neutron-atypical effects
 first in annealed pure iron and cold-worked pure iron, focusing initially
 on the rastering effect and the defect imbalance issues without the added
 complexity arising from microchemical evolution, and then focusing later
 on the same processes occurring in Fe-Cr binary alloys and then solute-bearing
 Fe-Cr alloys.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first of these studies we focused on void swelling of annealed pure
 iron in a beam-rastered irradiation, showing that the injected interstitial
 effect indeed suppresses swelling

 In the second of these studies it was shown that rastering suppresses swelling
 compared to non-rastered fixed beams

 shows the two most salient features are the very strong impact of the injected
 interstitial effect to suppress, to very high doses, the void swelling
 throughout the injected ion range, and the appearance of a double-peak
 swelling distribution in the region in front of injected ion range.
 A similar observation was made in self-ion irradiations on pure nickel
 many years earlier 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bullen1984,Badger1985"

\end_inset

.
 Occasionally, double peaks are observed in other alloys, but the possibility
 cannot be discounted that compositional segregation along the range might
 be contributing to this observation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the injected interstitial effect was not unexpected, the appearance
 of a double peak in the fore-range of iron and nickel was rather surprising,
 with the question entertained whether it might be an experimental artifact
 or a real characteristic of ion irradiation.
 In this paper we model the time-dependent development of depth-dependent
 void swelling in annealed pure iron as a function of irradiation temperature
 and accumulated dose produced during non-rastered irradiation with 3.5 MeV
 Fe ions.
 It is found that both the double peak and the injected interstitial suppression
 effects are consequences of the defect imbalance effect, reproducing the
 observed behavior.
 This model can then be used to forecast swelling behavior in pure iron
 and possibly more complex iron-base alloys for other temperatures, DPA
 rates, ion energies, rastering frequencies, etc.
 
\change_inserted 1028221600 1442852896
In particular, the double-peak is predicted to only manifest itself within
 a narrow window (

, the Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment, a finite element
 method framework.
 By fully coupled, we refer to the definition of all equations and material
 properties as functions of all possible independent variables (defect concentra
tions, temperature, ion beam current) rather than using any numerically
 convenient assumptions of constant or simplified material properties.
 Only the initial stages of point defect creation and subsequent void nucleation
 rates at zero time were studied, further stabilization and growth of voids
 typical of cluster dynamics simulations was not considered in this study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reader should therefore note what this study is and what it is not.
 It is a simple demonstration that accounting for a tiny fraction of injected
 interstitials greatly changes the qualitative form of the void swelling
 distribution.
 This study is not meant to be quantitative in any way, nor does it predict
 true, time-dependent microstructure evolution.

 bias model (PBM)

The VACANCY.TXT and RANGE.TXT files from SRIM (shown in Figure

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{injected\thinspace ions}{cm}$

 interstitial injection rates.
 The ballistic Frenkel pair (FP) production rate was multiplied by the experimen
tally measured beam current (200nA) and dividing by the beam area (1mm in
 diameter) in terms of the ionic flux:

Simultaneously, the spatially dependent ion range distribution from SRIM
 was converted to total injected interstitials (II) per nm, by also multiplying
 by the beam current density:

Next, the dislocation sink rate constant was calculated by first finding
 half the average distance between dislocations 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\frac{1}{2}d_{\bot}\right)$
\end_inset

 based on the dislocation density 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\rho_{\bot}\right)$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}d_{\bot}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi\rho_{\bot}}}\label{eq:Dislocation-Half-Distance}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and then using it to calculate the dislocation sink rate constant:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
K_{\bot,\left(v,i\right)}=\frac{2\pi D_{\left(v,i\right)}}{ln\left(\frac{\frac{1}{2}d_{\bot}}{r_{\bot\left(v,i\right)}}\right)}\label{eq:Dislocation-Sink-Rate}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathit{r_{\bot}}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\emph on
core size
\emph default
 of the dislocation for each type of defect, or the approximate radius of
 capture should a particular defect stray within this radius.
 The recombination rate constant was calculated as follows:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
K_{iv}=\frac{z_{iv}V_{Fe}\left(D_{v}+D_{i}\right)}{a_{Fe}^{2}}\label{eq:Recombination-Rate-Constant}

\end_inset

 Temperature-dependent diffusivities were calculated using an Arrhenius
 relation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D_{\left(v,i\right)}=D_{0}e^{\left(\frac{-E_{A_{\left(v,i\right)}}}{k_{B}T}\right)}\label{eq:Diffusivity-Equation}

To obtain the zero-time void nucleation rate behavior, the vacancy supersaturati
on is first calculated as follows:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S_{v}=\frac{D_{v}C_{v}-D_{i}C_{i}}{D_{v}C_{v}^{*}}\label{eq:Supersaturation}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This study is not a quantification of the true void nucleation rate, but
 rather an estimation of relative effects.
 Therefore the general 
\emph on
shape

 of a post-processed supersaturation vs.
 void nucleation rate curve derived from

 It is worth noting here that while the void nucleation rate at very low
 dose and the void swelling rates are not directly comparable, their qualitative
 shapes are expected to be similar.
 It is well known that voids and void nuclei constitute additional point
 defect sinks with their own biases, more appropriately treated using Master
 equation

This underscores the point that the quantity of interest in this study is
 the

spatially dependent vacancy supersaturation
\emph default
, of which the zero-time void nucleation rate is a very sensitive function.
 This function does not vary considerably in shape over a very wide temperature

 Therefore, the same void nucleation rate curve shape is used for different
 conditions and materials to illustrate the strong effect of the more subtle
 variations in vacancy supersaturation.
 The curve used was for the case of Ni at 427°C, with an interstitial/vacancy
 arrival ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\beta_{i}}{\beta_{v}}=0.9$

.
 The equation is as follows:

, and the SRIM data for damage production and ion range were binned into
 100 spatial nodes.
 Zero concentration Dirichlet boundary conditions were assumed at the ends
 of the mesh for simplicity, and because a free surface acts as a very strong
 sink for defects.
 The SolutionDT adaptive time stepping algorithm was used to accelerate
 simulations when appropriate.
 SolutionDT works by increasing the time step by a factor of 1.5 if the current
 time step's solution was found to deviate very little from the previous
 time step.

 the solution matrix, which yields an exact solution after prohibitively
 long times.

 without injected interstitials.
 Even though the excess injected interstitial fraction shows a very slight
 imbalance between defect production rates, in the hundreds of ppm on average,
 the resulting steady-state defect concentrations differ greatly.
 This imbalance, especially near the Bragg peak region of the ions where
 SRIM calculates the most damage, causes a shift in the damage peak towards
 the free surface.
 The effect of the free surface itself, which is modeled as an undepletable
 sink with a zero defect concentration, is also pronounced, preferentially
 removing interstitials in the vicinity due to their higher mobility.

 Prevalence of the sub-surface peak becomes more apparent at lower temperatures.
 This is due to injected interstitials, which peak just past the location
 of highest damage, locally suppressing vacancy concentration as temperature
 decreases, and therefore decreasing local vacancy supersaturation.
 Locations of both sub-surface and near-peak-damage maxima shift away from
 the free surface with increasing temperature.
 For other ion energies and DPA rates, the nucleation rate profiles will
 be different but will preserve the features shown for 3.5

Discussion

\begin_layout Subsection
Importance of the Injected Interstitial Effect
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results show qualitatively that the introduction of a subtle, spatially-depe
ndent defect imbalance may be responsible for significant changes in both
 magnitude and shape of spatially dependent void distributions evolving
 during ion irradiation.
 Injection of a very small fraction of injected interstitials, never more
 than tenths of a percent, has wide-reaching consequences.
 Interstitials are much more mobile, causing increased recombination at
 the location of peak ballistic damage, shifting the main damage peak towards
 the free surface by 100-200nm.
 In addition, suppression of vacancy concentration by increased recombination
 “exposes” the second peak near the free surface.
 This effect would not be seen without taking injected interstitials into
 account.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This indicates that the injected interstitial effect, which has been known
 for quite some time, must be accounted for when analyzing spatially dependent
 void swelling experiments employing ion beam irradiation.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Allen2005"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Cookson1993"

\end_inset

 mention irradiation inducing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nearly uniform damage,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in this case referring to ballistic radiation damage.
 A region of uniform resultant microstructural change is unlikely to form,
 though the higher the energy of the bombarding ion, the more uniform it
 may become in front of the ion stopping region.
 More recent studies mention taking data from a region underneath the surface,
 to avoid both the sub-surface and injected interstitial regions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Wang2015"

\end_inset

.
 Small changes in parameters, such as temperature, dose rate, and material
 purity (and therefore vacancy mobility) can reveal or obscure the double
 peak, changing the relative magnitudes of the injected interstitial and
 free surface effects.
 Care should therefore be taken when interpreting such data from experiments.
 It is therefore recommended to perform a spatially-dependent simulation
 of defect concentrations during the irradiation experiment, to avoid misinterpr
etation of data from a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

uniform region
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which may or may not exist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Modeling ion irradiation with and without injected interstitials at varying
 temperatures shows the increasing importance of the injected interstitials
 with decreasing vacancy mobility, as should be expected.
 With increasing temperature, localization of injected interstitial recombinatio
n decreases as both vacancies and interstitials become more mobile.
 As vacancies increase in mobility, their ability to reach the free surface
 from greater distances increases, shifting the sub-surface peak away from
 the surface.
 In addition, as interstitials become more mobile, they move farther on
 average before recombining or sinking, spreading out their localized excess
 recombination effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These studies show that injected interstitial effects cannot be ignored
 in simulations and experiments involving ion irradiation.
 Depending on the temperature and the dose rate of irradiation, the resulting
 vacancy supersaturation, and therefore the eventual void swelling profile,
 can take on very different shapes.
 Over-generalization of ion irradiation experiment behavior should therefore
 be remedied, partially by taking this strong injected interstitial effect
 into account.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Shortcomings of the Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This model is deliberately simple, neglecting the formation of defect clusters,
 dislocation forests, and other radiation defects which would serve as additiona
l point defect sinks.
 Initial simulations using the model in this study clearly show, however,
 the injected interstitial effect to weaken somewhat with increased sink
 density, which would be expected to evolve as the material is irradiated.
 Therefore, a quantitative measure of the injected interstitial effect will
 only be possible by completely accounting for radiation-induced microstructural
 changes, as proposed by Golubov et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 In addition, the injected interstitial effect has been observed in far
 more complex materials
\change_deleted 1028221600 1442853569
, such as oxide dispersion strengthened alloys MA956 and MA957
\change_unchanged
, even though the grain boundary and incoherent precipitate sink terms are
 much stronger.
 In these alloys the observed swelling vs, depth profiles show only the
 near-surface peak with total suppression in the injected interstitial zone,
 most likely as a consequence of their very high sink density.
 In simple materials such as iron (this study), nickel, and even 316 stainless
 steel where the sink density is much lower, ion irradiation usually, but
 not always, leads to a double peak distribution

 In Badger's work 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 the double peak in a very pure 316 model alloy moves from a double peak
 to a single peak as the temperature is increased, as was observed in this
 study.

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A spatially varying rate theory model for radiation defect production in
 ion-irradiated metals was modified to account for injected interstitials,
 and augmented with some elements of the production bias model (PBM).
 The presence of injected interstitials both suppresses and shifts the main
 damage peak towards the free surface, while also reducing the total vacancy
 supersaturation via increased recombination.
 This “exposes” a second peak,
